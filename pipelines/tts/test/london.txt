London is the capital of Great Britain, its political, economic and cultural centre.
It's one of the largest cities in the world. Its population is more than million people.
London is situated on the river Thames. The city is very old and beautiful.
It was founded more than two thousand years ago.
Traditionally London is divided into several parts: the City, the West End, the East End and Westminster.
The City is the oldest part of London, its financial and business centre. The heart of the City is the Stock Exchange.
Westminster is the most important part of the capital. It's the administrative centre.
The Houses of Parliament, the seat of the British Government, are there.
It's a very beautiful building with two towers and a very big clock called Big Ben.
Big Ben is really the bell which strikes every quarter of an hour. Opposite the Houses of Parliament is Westminster Abbey.
It's a very beautiful church built over 900 years ago. The tombs of many great statesmen, scientists and writers are there.
